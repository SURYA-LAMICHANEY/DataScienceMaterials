In this repository I have kept some the reading materials for data science which I have collected over a period of time while learning data science.
Most of the materials are downloaded from LinkedIn where experts from the data science field share these materials for the benefit of learners like us.
The materials contain books, cheatsheets and data science interview questions and answers. I hope this repository gets bigger in the future and serves every data science enthusiast
to achieve his goals.
